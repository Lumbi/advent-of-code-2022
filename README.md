### Solutions for the first 15 days of the Advent of Code 2022

After solving a few in JS, I decided to switch to a different language every day to spice things up. Languages were picked at random and I was familiar with some languages more than others. I also avoided using 3rd party libraries to experience the most raw form of each language and also because I don't want to pollute my computer a bunch of libraries. Because of the heavy switching and limited time though, I can say with confidence that I'm not proud of any of the solutions and I'm sure there are more idiomatic ways of solving each puzzles.

In the end, I think this was an interesting challenge that helped me compare many languages in a (relatively) short timespan.

Some personal findings:
- Most mainstream languages are basically the same for the purpose of these puzzles so I missed a lot of important features that each language had to offer
- The main difference between the languages I tried were functional versus imperative
- Functional languages that are lenient on side-effects seemed to be the best at solving these types of puzzles
- Rust is a very interesting language, I'd like to learn more

I stopped after Day 15 to focus on other stuff but this was a fun exercise and I would recommend trying out something similar. The early puzzles were very basic but I can see the difficulty ramping up from Day 14 and Day 15. Day 9 and Day 14 were my favourites because they were basically mini-simulations. Best of luck to others!
